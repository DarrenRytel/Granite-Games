## Echoes In The Dark: Design Document

### Concept
Far in the future, Robots are mass produced on Space stations that orbit Earth.
You play as a small defective engineering robot with malfunctioning optical sensors, discarded and doomed to be recycled.
You escape destruction in the tutorial level and must use Sound Waves to guide your escape of the station.

Mechanics
An intermittent pulse of sound projects in a cone from the front of the player every 2 seconds.
NOTE: the pulse will center around the player and light up immediate area
Each pulse highlights empty space in the direction the player is facing (objects, walls and floors etc. will remain black)
With physics based movement, the player controls thrusters on the character to change horizontal and vertical speed and momentum. 

Rules
Don’t bash into anything!
The robot is already damaged and thus very fragile, any collisions with enough force could make its reactor core go critical.
Escape as quickly as possible. Levels will be timed and extra points awarded based on how quickly you can find the exit. With limited vision, players will be forced to take risks to get the fastest times.

Level Design
30 levels, different each play through.
Each level procedurally generates 4 different connected rooms based on a 3x3 layout.
Each individual room is designed with varying traps and moving obstacles to avoid. 
Later levels generate more difficult rooms to increase the challenge.
Minimalist and atmospheric art style like in Limbo and Sunless Sea. Mostly in black and white.

Target Market
16 – 30 year olds.
Hardcore Gamers with fast reflexes who enjoy a challenge.
Speedrunners.
Gamers who enjoy difficult games like Super Meat Boy and Spelunky.
