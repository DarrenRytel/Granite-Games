## Vision In The Dark: Design Document

### Concept
Far in the future, Robots are mass produced on Space stations that orbit Earth.
You play as a small defective engineering robot with broken optical sensors must rely on broken camera that pulses every 2 seconds, discarded and doomed to be recycled, your Objective is to find spair parts and repair yourself.
You escape destruction in the tutorial level and must use tmeporary vision to guide your escape of the station.

### Mechanics
#### vision mechanic
An intermittent static pulse of vision projects from the players position allowing you to see a radius around the player.
the pulse will slowly fade away over time.
NOTE: the pulse will center around the player and light up immediate area
With physics based movement, the player controls thrusters on the character to change horizontal and vertical speed and momentum. 

### Rules
* Don’t bash into anything!
* The robot is already damaged and thus very fragile, any collisions with enough force could make its reactor core go critical.
* Escape as quickly as possible. Levels will be timed and extra points awarded based on how quickly you can find the exit. With limited vision, players will be forced to take risks to get the fastest times.

### Level Design
30 levels, different each play through.
Each level procedurally generates 4 different connected rooms based on a 3x3 layout.
Each individual room is designed with varying traps and moving obstacles to avoid. 
Later levels generate more difficult rooms to increase the challenge.
Minimalist and atmospheric art style like in Limbo and Sunless Sea. Mostly in black and white.

### Target Market
16 – 30 year olds.
Hardcore Gamers with fast reflexes who enjoy a challenge.
Speedrunners.
Gamers who enjoy difficult games like Super Meat Boy and Spelunky.
